## SpotRfy - R scripts to analyze Spotify data

The structure of these files is as such:

book - A folder with what is essentially daily scratch paper where I would try things out

data - The original datafiles

results - The final results explaining how to use the various scripts I developed

scripts - The scrupts referenced by other functions. Mostly scripts that get the Spotify access tokens. I've largely ignored these in git, so that I didn't need to worry about uploading them.
